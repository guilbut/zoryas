This software was created for sound and plasma art installation "Zoryas" imagined by Claire Williams and brought to life with the code of  Baptiste de la Gorce in 2019-2020. This installation is a production of Le Fresnoy - Studio National des Arts Contemporains.
This software has been made with the help of : 
- The royal observatory of Beligum thanks to Petra Vanlommel & Christophe Marqué.
- The E- Callisto network setup by Christian Monstein http://e-callisto.org/ giving us access to 24 h sun monitoring the electromagnetic activity of the sun with ... radiotelescopes around the world.

And the precious advice of: 
Jean Phillipe Uzan, cosmologue 
Renée Prange & Philipe Zarka from l'OBSPM of Paris
Sébastien Cabour, sound artist and technical advisor.

This software has been coded to sonify or translate live data into audible sound. Fits files mesured by radiotelescopes from the E- Callisto network are updated every 15 minutes on the E-Callisto server.This data is the suns electromagnetic activity mesured at different frequencys varying from 0 to 1600 mHz.
The python software reads the data as a spectrogramme in time and frequency translating them into sound frequencys from 0 - 400 hz.


This software has been made for an artistic purpose in order to see, hear and feel the otherwise inaudible activity of our star. The setup is on a RaspberryPi3 B+ and a mono track is transmitted to 5 transduceurs and basspumps. The spectator can experience the activity of the sun through a bone conduction setup. The other mono track is sent to a tesla coil which modulates 5 plasma glass sculptures. Each contain different noble gases that vary in intensity and effects according to the different frequencys. 
Low frequencys have been privileged for this specific setup.

The python software downloads the last hours of the E-Callisto data and selects the most intense activity to generate a stereo track in wav format.
